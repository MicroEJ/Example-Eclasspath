# Overview

This project gather all the examples of eclasspath. Eclasspath contains Java runtime libraries.

Note that to run them on board:

* If you are using MicroEJ SDK:
 * You need a supported board (see http://developer.microej.com/index.php?resource=JPF for a list of supported boards using MicroEJ SDK evaluation version)
 * And the associated platform binary .jpf file (retrieve it from the previous link and import it into MicroEJ SDK)

* If you are using MicroEJ Studio:
 * You need to convert them from standalone applications to sandboxed applications.
 * Follow the [How-To convert a standalone app into a sandboxed app](https://github.com/MicroEJ/How-To/tree/master/StandaloneToSandboxed) guide.
